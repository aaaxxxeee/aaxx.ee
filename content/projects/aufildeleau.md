au fil de l'eau is an immersive and interactive installation in which the audience is led through the depths of the ocean. the public is invited to contemplate and listen to the flora and fauna which inhabits these waters as well as interacting in various ways to affect this environment.

During the making of this group project I have worked on real-time fluid simulation, and I have developped the 3D aspects of the depths as well as the interactive components which were routed in between Touchdesigner and Unreal Engine.
