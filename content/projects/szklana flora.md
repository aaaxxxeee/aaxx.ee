“szklana flora” or “La flore de verre” is a collaborative project made with polish/german producer⠀[Jakub Stefaniak](www.instagram.com/hellosheg/) . 

The minute long piece is a contemplative exploration of textures and colors which was shown in front of the audience of the MAPP_MTL festival on the night of the 26th of September 2024. It was then played several times throughout the span of the festival, thus until the 29th of September.

It features three scenes each displaying an array of vegetation flowing through the wind, which were simulated inside of Houdini. The textures and colors were then post-processed inside of After Effects.
