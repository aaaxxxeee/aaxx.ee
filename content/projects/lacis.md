*“Place des Arts’ screen mosaic, a unique installation composed of 35 digital screens and light tubes, presents six digital artworks on the theme of Labyrinthe, created by the UQAM’s School of Visual and Media Arts.”*⠀[Village numérique](https://village-numerique.mutek.org/en/circuit/labyrinthe-by-students-from-the-uqam-s-school-of-visual-and-media-arts)

Lacis is a contemplative piece meant to mimick the flow of foot traffic in the area. The digital ribbons flow indefinitely in a seamless loop, they come and go and disappear in the darkness only to come back a few seconds later.

Originally run from may 1st to june 21, the project was re-run for the 26th edition of the MUTEK festival as part of the "Village numérique"
