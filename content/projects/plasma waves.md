Plasma waves is a collaborative and ever-evolving project with multidisciplinary artist Santiago Betancour (a.k.a EscapedMind). 

The project is an exploration of the relation between water and electricity, it uses an improvised instrument, a plasma ball from which we record the vibrations caused by its man controlled disruption.

The ambient soundscape is accompanied by interactive visuals with the purpose of offering an experience that you can sense from both sight and hearing.
